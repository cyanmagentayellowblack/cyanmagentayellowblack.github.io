# Roblox Chat Bypasser Tool

The Roblox Chat Bypasser Tool is a web-based application, forked and enhanced from its original creators, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It transforms text to explore how chat filters, like those in Roblox, can be bypassed by applying various processing options. This tool is intended for **educational purposes only**, helping users understand text filtering mechanisms in a controlled environment. It runs seamlessly on GitHub Pages, Playgrounds, or locally in any modern web browser.

**Credits**: A huge thank you to @Shuggreal for creating this powerful tool and @Dustan Giles for preserving and maintaining it. This forked version builds on their work with additional tweaks and improvements.

**Important Disclaimer**: This tool is for educational and experimental use only. Bypassing chat restrictions in Roblox or other platforms may violate their Terms of Service and could result in account suspension or legal consequences. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with Roblox’s policies and applicable laws.

## Introduction

Originally created by @Shuggreal and preserved by @Dustan Giles, the Roblox Chat Bypasser Tool allows users to input text and transform it using various processing options to study how chat filters work. Whether you’re a developer exploring text manipulation or a researcher studying filter evasion techniques, this tool provides a simple, web-based interface for educational experimentation. Type your sentences, choose a processing option, and see the transformed result!

## Features

- **Text Transformation**: Convert input text with customizable processing options (e.g., character substitution, encoding) to explore chat filter behavior.
- **Intuitive Interface**: A clean text input bar and processing option selector for easy use.
- **Multiple Processing Options**: Choose from different transformation methods, such as basic substitution or advanced encoding, to vary the output.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on GitHub Pages, Playgrounds, or locally in any modern browser.

## Prerequisites

To use or deploy the Roblox Chat Bypasser Tool, you need:
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository).
- A GitHub account (if deploying to GitHub Pages).
- An internet connection for Playgrounds or GitHub Pages deployment.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/roblox-chat-bypasser-tool.git`
   - Or download the ZIP file from the repository.

2. **Run Locally**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the tool locally.

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Push the repository to a GitHub repository.
   - Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, selecting the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
   - Access the site at `https://[your-username].github.io/roblox-chat-bypasser-tool`.

4. **Run on Playgrounds**:
   - Upload the project files to a platform like Swift Playgrounds or similar web-based IDEs supporting HTML/CSS/JS.
   - Run the project directly in the Playgrounds environment.

## Usage

1. **Open the Tool**:
   - Access the deployed site (e.g., via GitHub Pages) or open `index.html` locally.

2. **Transform Text**:
   - Enter a sentence in the text bar (e.g., "Hello Roblox").
   - Select a processing option from the dropdown (e.g., "Basic Substitution" or "Advanced Encoding").
   - Click "Transform" to generate the bypassed version of the text.
   - Copy the transformed text for use in a safe, non-production environment.

3. **Example**:
   - Input: "Hello Roblox"
   - Processing Option: Basic Substitution
   - Output: "H3ll0 R0bl0x"
   - Input: "W3lc0m3"
   - Processing Option: Reverse Substitution
   - Output: "Welcome"

**Note**: Use this tool only in controlled, educational settings. Do not use it to bypass chat restrictions in Roblox or other platforms, as this may violate their Terms of Service.
